1. Random vulnerability
You've stumbled onto a significant vulnerability in a commonly used cryptographic library. It turns out that the random number generator it uses frequently produces the same primes when it is generating keys.
Exploit this knowledge to factor the (hexadecimal) keys below, and enter your answer as the last six digits of the largest factor you find (in decimal).
Key 1:
1c7bb1ae67670f7e6769b515c174414278e16c27e95b43a789099a1c7d55c717b2f0a0442a7d49503ee09552588ed9bb6eda4af738a02fb31576d78ff72b2499b347e49fef1028182f158182a0ba504902996ea161311fe62b86e6ccb02a9307d932f7fa94cde410619927677f94c571ea39c7f4105fae00415dd7d
Key 2:

2. RSA
Make a program that will implement the RSA algorithm made by you and with help of this program you can encrypt any string and then decrypt it.
Restrictions:
You must not use any libraries for this exercise.
3. Check password
We all use many passwords every day but is every password we use hard enough to crack. Your password is considered strong if it follows this rules:
-It has at least 8 characters and at most 20 characters.
-It has a minimum of 1 lower case letter [a-z] and a minimum of 1 upper case letter [A-Z] and a minimum of 1 numeric character [0-9] and a minimum of 1 special character: ~`!@#$%^&*()-_+={}[]|\;:"<>,./?
-It does not contain three repeating characters in a row (i.e.,“abbbcc-0”is weak, but  is “ abcbbcc-0”strong).
Given a string password, return the minimum number of steps required to make the password strong. If the password is already strong, return the message “good”.
In one step, you can: 
-Insert one character 
-Delete one character 
-Replace one character
Restrictions:
You must not use any libraries for this exercise.
Example 1:
Input: password = "a"
Output: 7
Example 2:
Input: password = "Bb1"
Output: 5
Example 3:
Input: password = "aaB-d2c1"
Output: good


4. Palindrome
You are given a string str. You can convert str to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it. Return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.
Restrictions:
You must not use any libraries for this exercise.
Example 1:
Input: str = "aabbcbbaaa"
Output: “aaabbcbbaaa”
Example 2:
Input: str = "abcd"
Output: “dcbabcd”


5. Cracking the password
You obtained a secret message that was encrypted using Vigenère cipher with a simple pass phrase. Thus, it is vulnerable to frequency analysis. Decode this message and find out what does this message say and what is the encryption key.
Cipher message:

Bonus: Mastermind
In this problem we need to create our own Mastermind game. In our version of Mastermind game users can choose between two versions of the game: auto and manual. In the auto version the computer will randomly select a secret code and the user tries to guess it, based on the deterministic clues given by the computer and in the manual version the user will input the secret code and another user tries to guess it based on clues that appear on screen. You must make this game playable in the terminal.
Bonus task:
Make for your game a graphical interface
